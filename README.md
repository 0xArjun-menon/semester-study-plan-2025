would you like me to:
1. generate all 4 `/progress/week*.md` files with day-wise tasks ✅  
2. add an **automation script** that auto-commits “Day Complete ✅” each time you check off a box?  

if yes, I’ll generate the **entire project code + structure** in one block so you can copy directly into your GitHub repo.
